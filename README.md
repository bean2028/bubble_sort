# bubble_sort  

Create array of sortable items  
Get length of array  
Initialize 'swapped' variable, set it to false  
Loop over pairs of items  
- If pair of items is out of order, swap them and change 'swapped' variable to true  
- Subtract 1 from length of array after first loop, as the right most item will be in correct place after one loop  
Continue to loop over items until a loop is completed with 'swapped' variable remaining false  
Return the sorted array
